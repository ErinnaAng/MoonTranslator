## Future Plans

- **Enhancements:** Moon'Edge will continue to evolve with enhancements and features based on user feedback. 
- **Expanded Library:** Expect a growing library of novels as the project progresses, offering a diverse range of genres and themes.
- **Making Store:** Moon'Edge soon will open a new branch web for selling all kind of goods that still related to the novels.

*Note: Moon'Edge is a project for my midterm and final-exam. So the project may be drastically chnage base on the professor assessment rubric*
